# Provably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a provably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter the lottery by paying for a ticket
   The ticket fees will go to the winner of the draw
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner programmatically
3. Using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation
   Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
   Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger
